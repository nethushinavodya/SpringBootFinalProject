# SpringBootFinalProject

To build a comprehensive esports platform—GameArenaX—designed specifically for the Sri 
Lankan gaming community, enabling players to join and represent clans in tournaments, 
streamers to host and manage events with features like auto-generated brackets, and fans 
to watch tournaments live without logging in. The platform promotes professionalism and 
fairness by allowing streamers to purchase a Verified Badge via PayHere, which unlocks 
premium features such as bracket automation and email notifications to followers. With 
support for real-time clan chat, leaderboards, payment integration, and live streaming, 
GameArenaX aims to deliver a fully integrated, scalable, and user-friendly esports 
environment that connects all participants in one digital space.
